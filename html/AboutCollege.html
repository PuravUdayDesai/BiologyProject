                                <h4>About College</h4>
                                <p>

                                    The institute is consistently ranked amongst the top 20 technical colleges in India and its alumni have contributed a lion’s share in development of national infrastructure.
                                </p>
                                <h4>History of College</h4>
                                <p>
                                    COEP's precursor, The Poona Engineering Class and Mechanical School was opened in July 1854, with an aim to provide suitable learning to the subordinate officers in the Public Works Department. The School was situated in Bhawani Peth, Poona , and the
                                    accommodation consisted of three small detached houses for teaching purposes and a separate house for the Principal.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In June 1865 Mr. Theodore Cooke, M.A , who held that appointment for 28 years was appointed Principal. The foundation stone of the new college was laid by His Excellency the Governor, Sir Bartle Frere, on the 5th August 1865.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    College was affiliated to University of Bombay in 1866. In 1868 the College moved to the New Buildings. The college was divided into three departments for matriculated and unmatriculated students.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In 1879 two new classes, an Agricultural class and a Forest class , were added to the college , and the name of the college was changed from " The Poona Civil Engineering College " to " The College of Science".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In 2003, the college got autonomous status, thus giving it the freedom to set its own curricula and manage its own finances. This has been the biggest change as far as pedagogy at COEP is concerned.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Today, COEP offers nine UG and twenty-four PG programmes, and has more than 3200 students enrolled in its various courses.
                                </p>
